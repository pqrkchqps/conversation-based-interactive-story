An interactive story called, "Pieces of Infinity and a Voice in the Void." 

The premise is: 

The player is able to hold a conversation with a person name Abel who lives in a parallel universe on a distant planet.  

This planet has technology that interacts with the spiritual realm which is how Abel and you are able to talk.  

Abel is not a phototypical protagonist and instead only acts as a mentor (aka old wise man) to other characters in the game.  

The player influences the outcome of the story by giving Abel forsight on what to do next.  

This forsight is gained by the player and not Abel as it is later revealed that Abel has just created a time travel loop and the effects of time travel seems to erase certain memories.  

Each timeline is unique so the events that happen don't repeat always repeat themselves, but through gathering papers to a mysterious journel and following recent events Abel and the player are able to piece together what has happened and how to master time travel and change the future.
